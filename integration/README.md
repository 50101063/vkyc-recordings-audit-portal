# Integration

This directory is reserved for future integration tasks.

Currently, all frontend and backend integration is handled directly through API calls, but this folder can be used for:

-   **Third-Party Service Integrations:** Code related to connecting with external services.
-   **Integration Test Suites:** Scripts and configurations for running end-to-end integration tests.
-   **Data Synchronization Scripts:** Scripts for syncing data between the application and other systems.
